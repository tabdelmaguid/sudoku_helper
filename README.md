# sudoku_helper

A program created while learning Clojure.

The program starts with a blank board, where all digits 1-9 are available in all cells.
As the user selects numbers in cells, the available options in other cells are reduced accordingly.
The program, currently, uses a very basic possibility reduction logic. It may evolve with more sophisticated
logic.
